## The most Advanced LinkedIn Job Search Bulk Scraper

Our powerful tool helps you search LinkedIn Jobs by job titles and filter by locations, companies, and many other parameters without compromising security or violating platform policies. Extract full job and company details. Use multiple job title and locations for mass scraping. The actor is designed to be fast, reliable, and easy to use.

### Key Benefits

- No cookies or account required: Access job data without sharing cookies or risking account restrictions
- Low pricing: $1 per 1k jobs.
- Fast response times deliver data in seconds ðŸš€ Extract 1,000 LinkedIn Jobs ~ 2 Minutes
- No caching, fresh data.
- Concurrency: each actor works scraping 6 jobs at a time.

## How It Works

- (required) List of job tiles. (e.g., `Software Engineer`, `Data Scientist`, `Product Manager`)
- (optional) List of locations where they currently live (e.g., `New York`, `San Francisco`, `London`). Please note that LinkedIn does not always understand your text queries. For example for "UK" query it will apply "Ukraine" location, so you should use "United Kingdom" in this case. Try this out first in the location filter input of LinkedIn search at `https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?geoUrn=%5B%22103644278%22%5D` - we will use the first suggestion from the autocomplete popup when you type your location.
- (optionally) List of LinkedIn Company URLs or company names (e.g., `Google`, `Meta`, `Amazon`)
- (optionally) Sort by `relevance` or `date`
- (optionally) Filter by `workplaceType` (e.g., `Remote`, `Hybrid`, `On-site`)
- (optionally) Filter by `employmentType` (e.g., `Full-time`, `Part-time`, `Contract`)
- (optionally) Filter by `experienceLevel` (e.g., `Entry Level`, `Mid Level`, `Senior Level`)
- (optionally) Filter by `salary` (e.g., `100000-150000`)
- (optionally) Filter by `under10Applicants` (e.g., `true`, `false`)
- (optionally) Filter by `easyApply` (e.g., `true`, `false`)
- (optionally) Filter by `postedLimit` (e.g., `Past hout`, `Past 24 hours`, `Past Week`, `Past Month`)
- (optional) List of LinkedIn industry IDs (e.g., `4`, `5`, `6`). You can find the full list of IDs in the [LinkedIn Industries](https://github.com/HarvestAPI/linkedin-industry-codes-v2/blob/main/linkedin_industry_code_v2_all_eng_with_header.csv).

Other params (optionally):

- `maxItems` - Maximum number of jobs to scrape per each search query. If you set to 0, it will scrape all available pages or up to 40 pages per search query.

### Data You'll Receive

- Full job details: title, description text, description HTML, location, posted date, salary, benefits, employment type and more.
- Full company details: name, logo, employee count, industries, and more.
- Job stats: number of applicants, views.
- Job application URL: direct link to apply for the job.
